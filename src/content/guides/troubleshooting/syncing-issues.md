# Syncing Issues

If your bank accounts aren't syncing properly, here are some common solutions.

## Common Causes

### Bank Website Changes
Banks occasionally update their websites, which can temporarily break the connection.

**Solution:** Wait 24-48 hours as our team works to update the connection. If the issue persists, contact support.

### Changed Credentials
If you've recently changed your banking password, the connection will break.

**Solution:** 
1. Go to **Settings > Accounts**
2. Find the affected account
3. Click **"Reconnect"**
4. Enter your new credentials

### Multi-Factor Authentication
Some banks require MFA for each connection attempt.

**Solution:** Check your email or phone for authentication codes and complete the verification process.

### Bank Maintenance
Banks sometimes perform maintenance that temporarily disables external connections.

**Solution:** Wait a few hours and try again. Check your bank's website for maintenance announcements.

## Forcing a Manual Sync

To manually trigger a sync:

1. Go to your **Dashboard**
2. Click the **refresh icon** next to your accounts
3. Wait for the sync to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

## When to Contact Support

Contact us if:
- The issue persists for more than 48 hours
- You see error messages during sync
- Transactions are appearing incorrectly
- Your bank isn't in our supported list
