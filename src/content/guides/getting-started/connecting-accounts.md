# Connecting Your Bank Accounts

Budget Warden can automatically import transactions from your bank accounts, making it easy to track your spending without manual entry.

## Security First

Your security is our top priority. Here's how we protect your data:

- **Bank-level encryption** - All data is encrypted using 256-bit SSL
- **Read-only access** - We can never move money or make transactions
- **Secure authentication** - We use industry-standard OAuth connections

## Supported Banks

Budget Warden supports thousands of financial institutions including:

- Major national banks
- Credit unions
- Online-only banks
- Credit card companies
- Investment accounts

## How to Connect an Account

1. Navigate to **Settings > Accounts**
2. Click **"Add Account"**
3. Search for your financial institution
4. Enter your banking credentials on your bank's secure site
5. Select which accounts to link
6. Wait for initial transaction sync (usually 1-2 minutes)

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If you're having trouble connecting your account:

- Ensure you're using the correct login credentials
- Check if your bank requires multi-factor authentication
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the account
- Contact support if issues persist

## Manual Transaction Entry

If your bank isn't supported or you prefer not to link accounts, you can always enter transactions manually.
