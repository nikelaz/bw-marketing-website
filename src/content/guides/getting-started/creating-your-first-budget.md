# Creating Your First Budget

Welcome to Budget Warden! This guide will walk you through creating your first budget.

## Step 1: Access the Budget Creation Screen

After logging in, click the **"New Budget"** button in the top navigation bar or on your dashboard.

## Step 2: Choose a Budget Template

You can start from scratch or choose from one of our pre-made templates:

- **Zero-Based Budget** - Every dollar has a job
- **50/30/20 Budget** - Needs, wants, and savings
- **Envelope Budget** - Traditional category-based approach

## Step 3: Set Your Income

Enter your monthly income sources. Budget Warden supports multiple income streams.

## Step 4: Create Categories

Organize your spending into categories that make sense for your lifestyle. Common categories include:

- Housing
- Transportation
- Food & Groceries
- Utilities

## Step 5: Allocate Funds

Distribute your income across your categories. The goal is to allocate every dollar so you know exactly where your money is going.
